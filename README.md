# NYC Bikes Visualization JavaScript-Project

###Abstract:
The primary purpose of the visualization will be to provide users with information on the number of bicycles used in different areas of NYC. A heatmap can be generated based on the frequency of bikes in nyc neighborhoods and overlayed with an interactive map of NYC. The goal would be to allow a user to to see a high level heatmap of bikes in NYC as well as zoom into particular areas of interest and see changes in patterns over time.  Depending on the time progress made in the project and potential need for more data, the visualization can be expanded to include other shared mobility services such as electric scooters.  

###Technologies:
1. NYC Counter Data/API:
   - Option 1: NYC Open Data Information on bike counts through Socrata
   - Option 2: Citi Bike Share real-time system data through GBFS Feed 
   - Option 3: Shared Mobility API's (bikes, e-scooters, etc.)
2. Map Visualization API: (Potentially both options below)
   - Option 1: D3js API (map)
   - Option 2: Google Maps API
